# CognitiveModelingHomework

This is a repo where all of my partner and I's homework for the cognitive modeling class will go.  Cognitive Modeling is useful for psychology and cognitive science since it helps these fields to simplify our understanding of the mind which is an incredibly complex system to study.  A model simplify's the thing in which it is modeling so cognitive modeling simplify's the mind.  Since these fields mainly focus on studying the mind being able to simplify the subject is extremely useful.
